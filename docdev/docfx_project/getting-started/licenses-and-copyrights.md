# Licenses and Copyrights

The file `LICENSE.TXT` in the main folder of the repo is the leading license
information, even if it does not show up in the Visual Studio solution. To
update all dependent license files, manually start `src\CopyLicense.ps1`.

Some plug-ins require a separate license. These separate licenses are given
in `LICENSE-PLUGIN.txt` in the corresponding directory of the plug-in. 

You should add a copyright note for each major contribution in the corresponding
files:
1) The copyright note should start with `Copyright (c)` followed by the time 
   span of the contribution.
    
2) You should put the full name of the legal entity (*e.g.*, 
   `Phoenix Contact GmbH & Co. KG`); a simple name (Phoenix Contact) will *not* 
   do! 
3) Each copyright note should indicate the contact to the legal entity in the 
   angle brackets (*e.g.*, 
  `<https://www.festo.com/net/de_de/Forms/web/contact_international>`).
4) The author of the contribution is optional (unless the contributor is a 
   private person, of course). If there are multiple authors, please indicate 
   only the organization and omit the individual contributors.
5) All the copyrights of a file are joined into a single comment block 
   (`/* ... */`).
6) Reference all the used libraries and dependencies in the copyright block as
   well.

```cs
